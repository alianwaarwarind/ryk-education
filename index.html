    <section id="intro-section">
        <p>In the district of Rahim Yar Khan, a staggering <strong>673,000 children</strong> between the ages of 5 and 16 are currently out of school.</p>
        <p>But a statistic is not just a number. It is a child. It is a dream.</p>
        <div id="ali-container">
            <span id="ali">üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</span>
            <p class="ali-text">Meet Ali. He represents just one of these children. His dreams are of becoming a pilot, soaring above the very fields where he now toils, never having stepped inside a classroom.</p>

        <p>This is the harsh reality. Each figure you see represents a life, a dream, a future unwritten.</p>
        <p>The scale of the problem is immense, but it is not invisible. Not anymore.</p>
        <p>Their future is our shared responsibility. What we do next matters.</p>
