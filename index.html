        <p>In Rahim Yar Khan, a district vibrant with life, there are <strong>451,123</strong> children who have never, not even once, stepped inside a school.</p>
        <p>This isn't just a statistic. It's a generation of silent potential.</p>
        <p>It's 451,123 stories unwritten, 451,123 futures dimmed before they can begin.</p>
        <p>We often see numbers, but we rarely feel their weight. Let's try to visualize just a fraction of that number.</p>

        <p>This is Ali. He represents one of them.</p>
        <p>As you scrolled, 5,000 figures appeared. Each one represents almost <strong>90 children</strong>.</p>
        <p>They aren't just figures on a screen. They are children waiting for a chance.</p>
        <p>The scale of the problem is immense, but it is not invisible. Not anymore.</p>
        <p>What we do next matters. Their future is our shared responsibility.</p>
